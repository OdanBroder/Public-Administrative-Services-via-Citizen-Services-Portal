# Public Administrative Services via Citizen Services Portal

## Overview

This project addresses the secure provision of public administrative services through a **Citizen Services Portal**, focusing on digital document validation, user authentication, and secure access. It leverages **post-quantum cryptographic techniques** and **QR code-based authentication** to ensure data privacy and integrity in government operations.

---

## 🔍 Application Scenarios

### 1. Gaps
- Identification of **security vulnerabilities** and gaps in current citizen service portals.
- Risks include **data breaches**, **unauthorized access**, **lack of encryption**, and **inefficient authentication mechanisms**.

### 2. Reliable Arguments for the Gaps
- Real-world incidents highlight the need for improvement:
  - *India Aadhaar Leak (2018)* – exposed personal data of over 1.1 billion citizens.
  - *Estonian ID Card Vulnerability (2017)* – flaws in cryptographic keys used in ID cards.
- These breaches underscore the urgency for **post-quantum secure solutions**.

### 3. Motivations
- Government services handle **highly sensitive personal and national data**.
- Ensuring **privacy, integrity**, and **secure digital access** is crucial for citizen trust and national security.
